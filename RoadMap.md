## 🎯 Golden Rules

1. **Never look at the solution first** - Struggle for at least 15 min
2. **Write after every problem** - Pattern → Signal → Connection
3. **2-3 problems/day, not 10** - Depth over quantity
4. **Review before starting new** - First 15 min = spaced repetition
5. **Code it, don't just read it** - Type and run every problem
